                    <h3>How it started...</h3> <br> 
                    I first got close to programming in highschool (~2017) after taking a 
                    course on <b>game development</b> with GML in GameMaker Studio.
                    <br><br>
                    I then spent two years taking courses on video game programming with <b>Unity and C#</b>, 
                    while participating in multiple game jams with friends. Some of the resulting games
                    (<i>The Key</i>, <i>Space Rewinders</i>, <i>Frank</i>) are listed on the section above!
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout my final year of highschool and first two years of university (2020-2022), I 
                    worked as a <b>freelance game developer</b>, providing complete solutions for clients all around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    Working on <b>real-life, professional projects</b> with Unity and C# allowed me to learn more about good coding practices, 
                    especially SOLID principles and design patterns in OOP.
                    <br> I also learned a lot about <b>designing</b> products that people like using.  
                    <br><br>
                    During 2022 and 2023, I focused solely on school. I'm pursuing a <b>bachelor's degree 
                    in computer science</b> at 
                    <a href="https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar" class="about-me__link" target="_blank"> FaMAF, UNC</a> - taking 
                    lots of cool courses and working on cool projects :)
                    <br><br>
                    <!-- Some of these include building a small graphics renderer for a Raspberry Pi in bare ARMv8 assembler,
                    writing a scheduler and messing with the kernel of xv6 (a UNIX-based OS), building a filesystem, training NNs,
                    and doing (lots) of math and classic algorithms + data structures, mainly in C.
                    <br><br> -->
                    On July 2023, I was awarded a small <b>scolarship</b> to participate in the ECI 2023, a yearly event that
                    takes place at the University of Buenos Aires. There, I learned about using fuzzing for compiler testing,
                    and about complementary ways of leveraging AI to improve prediction tasks. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>So, right now...</h3> <br> 
                    Since February 2024, I've been working as a <b>contractor for Scale AI</b>, <b>writing</b> and <b>reviewing code</b> data
                    eventually used for the SFT/RLHF of Scale AI clients' models, <b>helping fine-tune the current SOTA LLMs</b>, improving
                    their coding abilities. 
                    <br><br>
                    This involves writing code (as well as reviewing and enforcing styling and good practices) in lots of 
                    different languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Javascript, Java, <i>and even Haskell and ASM</i>),
                    as well as learning and applying different technologies (i.e. Swift, Go) based on specific client needs.
                    <br><br>
                    Going into 2025, I'm particularly interested in finishing my bachelor's degree, as well as exploring 
                    practical, real-world applications of AI models, going into low-level computer architecture, HDLs, 
                    more math, and lots of other things! 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>I'm open for new work</b> and actively looking for internship/full-time opportunities <i>(preferably after August 2025)</i>!
                    <br><br>
